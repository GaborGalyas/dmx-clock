# dmx-clock
Files of the dmx controlled neopixel clock
You can find 2 versions of the code, one for the wemos d1 mini with wifi art-net, and the second version is for an atmega 328 based arduino version for wired dmx.
I seem to have lost the pcb manufacturing files somewhere, working on getting the gerber files and all the other stuff together.
